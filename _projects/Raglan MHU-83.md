In my time at Raglan I did a lot of work on the NGAML, a modified MHU-83 one of the projects I got to work on with the NGAML was the new dashboard layour for the vehicle, we replaced a lot of the old components to bring it to the 21st centrury and to have it work with its new all electric power train. I also had to do a lot of workshopping to fit the new wiring harness and other peripherals on the dashboard 



I am proud to have this now in the hands of airmen in the new pilot program going out, and the new modified dashboard has not only reduced the total line items on the new NGAML but it also reduces manufacturing hours necessary to retrofit an MHU-83
