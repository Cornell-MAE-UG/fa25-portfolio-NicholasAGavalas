For MAE 3230 We were assigned to dissect a bike trainer. The bike trainers primary purpose is to dissipate energy put into it by heating up a fluid. We ended up calling it the bike dyno until we realized it didn't measure anything. For the project I did the Coefficent of power and coefficent of torque calculations I also helped out with the centripetal force calculationas for trying to estimate torque dissipated and compare it to the number the manual provides. We all worked together on taking apart the trainer. Most importnatly, I provided cake for the whole group.
