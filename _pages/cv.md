#### Objective
Hi, I’m Nicholas, a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for hands-on design, analysis, and manufacturing. I currently work on the brakes system for Cornell Racing, where I design and validate components to make our car lighter, stronger, and more reliable.  
My engineering experience spans vehicle systems, structural and thermal analysis, harness design, prototyping, CAD, and control systems. Through internships and technical project teams, I’ve contributed to battery systems, instrumentation platforms, wind-energy hardware, and performance automotive systems.
