#### Objective
Hi, I’m Nicholas, a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. When I’m not in class, you can usually find me in the autolab working on the brakes system for Cornell Racing. I spend most of my time designing, analyzing, and manufacturing components that make the car lighter, faster, and more reliable.
I’ve had the chance to get a ton of hands-on engineering experience through school and internships. Last summer, I worked at Raglan, where I designed parts for their ongoing projects, everything from battery enclosures to wiring harnesses and shop hardware. Before that, at GAIA and ECS, I worked on projects that combined sustainability and engineering, like developing wind turbine systems and bicycle instrumentation for use in rural communities.
